Examples
==============================================

D is a complex multi-paradigm programming language. At the same time, if you know C programming language and you want to start using D then you just need to look through some examples.


.. tip:: All examples available on GitHub_.

.. _GitHub: http://github.com/andralex/thenextafterc

Hello, World!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
C programs can be easily translated to D.
The following program prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/helloworld.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4 


D `doesn't have a preprocessor <http://dlang.org/pretod.html>`_.
Use ``import core.stdc.MODULE;`` construction to import ``MODULE`` from the `C Standard library`_.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/helloworld1.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4

Module ``core.stdc.stdio`` contains the ``puts`` prototype: 

.. code-block:: d

    extern(C) @system nothrow @nogc int puts(in char* s);

Common D "Hello, World!" program which is based on Phobos looks more simple:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/helloworld2.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4	

Phobos_ is the standard runtime library that comes with the D language compiler.

.. seealso:: To find a collection of common C techniques, and to find out how to do the corresponding task in D click `here  <http://dlang.org/ctod.html>`_. However most of them can be implemented in C style.

Simple project with dub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DUB_ is a build tool for D projects with support for automatically retrieving dependencies and integrating them in the build process. The design emphasis is on maximum simplicity for simple projects, while providing the opportunity to customize things when needed. 

To create the initial project with name ``component``, run ``dub init component``.

Remove automatically created ``component/source/app.d`` file 
and create the following file structure

.. code-block:: text

    dub.json
    component/
        source/
            component/
                mod.d
                package.d

where ``component/package.d`` is the main module ``component``

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/dub-example/component/source/component/package.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4   

and ``component/mod.d`` is the inner module ``component.mod``

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/dub-example/component/source/component/mod.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4   

To test this module, run ``dub test`` from package's folder.

``removeSingleLineComments`` can be imported with ``import component;`` or ``import component.mod;``.
To use *component* package, put the following dependency into your project's dub.json into the dependencies section:

.. code-block:: js

    {
        ...
        "dependencies": {
            "component": "~master"
        }
    }

Plotting with matplotlib (python)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are two projects that can be used with the D programming language:

	+ Plotcli_ is a command line application written in D that can create plots from text/csv files and from piped data, making it useful during data analysis.
	+ PLplot_ is a cross-platform software package written in C for creating scientific plots. It includes low-level D bindings.

But these two are not so convenient to use, in comparison with matplotlib.

matplotlib_ is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and different graphical user interface toolkits. To integrate with python the PyD package can be used.

PyD_ is a library that provides seamless interoperability between the D programming language and Python.
The minimal configuration file for this example is

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/matplotlib/dub.json
    :language: json
    :tab-width: 4

.. note:: The `python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and matplotlib should be installed. PyD searches the version of the python that is noted in the sub-configuration (``"pyd": "python34"`` in this example). For more information, see `the PyD's dub configuration file <https://github.com/ariovistus/pyd/blob/master/dub.json>`_.

The `following program <https://github.com/andralex/thenextafterc/tree/master/examples/matplotlib>`_
reads data from a file and runs ``show_histogram.py``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/matplotlib/source/app.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4

``show_histogram.py`` is located in ``views/``
folder that is used by dub as a default string import [#stringimport]_ folder.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/matplotlib/views/show_histogram.py
    :language: python
    :tab-width: 4

.. image:: /img/hist.png
    :alt: Histogram image

.. [#stringimport] Strings can be imported at compile time.

Web Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Web application is a pretty good example of the last chapters of any book, where the reader is suggested to make use of the means of expression in the language. As a rule, web application is a complex product, both in terms of knowledge of the language and in terms of code complexity of the used libraries.

And this example is no exception. Then why do people who want to learn D language very quickly still need example of web app? Many of them have a reason and it is that they need to integrate quickly programs written in D with other services, programming languages and databases. 

The article "`Creating a simple restful web app with node.js, Express, and MongoDB <http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/>`_" by Christopher Buecheler is taken as a basis for this example.

.. image:: /img/vibed-mongo.png
    :alt: vibe.d web app

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a skeleton web application, run:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ dub init vibed-mongo vibe.d

This will make the directory ``vibed-mongo`` with a minimal HTTP server based on vibe.d_.

.. _vibe.d: http://vibed.org


The configuration file ``dub.json`` will look something like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/vibed-mongo/dub.json
    :language: json
    :tab-width: 4

The version ``"VibeDefaultMain"`` includes the main function defined by default.

The project has the following structure:

.. code-block:: text

    dub.json            - package information
    source/             - D source code
        app.d
        service.d
    views/              - Diet templates
        index.dt
        layout.dt
    public/             - static directories
        javascripts/
            global.js
        styles
            style.css
        favicon.ico

After installing MongoDB_, run the server

.. code-block:: shell

    $ mongod


In another console run the Mongo interpreter

.. code-block:: shell

    $ mongo
    > use vibed
    switched to db vibed
    > db.createCollection("userlist", {autoIndexID : true})
    { "ok" : 1 }
    > db.userlist.insert({
        'username' : 'test1',
        'email' : 'test1@test.com',
        'fullname' : 'Bob Smith',
        'age' : 27,
        'location' : 'San Francisco',
        'gender' : 'male'
        })
    WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
    > exit
    bye

The above script creates a ``vibed`` database with a ``userlist`` collection, which will contain one record.

Patches
^^^^^^^^^

Comparing with the original article ``global.js`` was slightly changed:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/vibed-mongo/public/javascripts/global.js
    :language: js
    :tab-width: 4
    :lines: 96-107

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/vibed-mongo/public/javascripts/global.js
    :language: js
    :tab-width: 4
    :lines: 129-138

Diet Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Diet templates`_  are HTML templates which are statically compiled down to native D code.
Diet templates syntax equals that of Jade templates with the exception of some of the advanced syntax features.

First lines of ``index.dt``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/vibed-mongo/views/index.dt
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4
    :lines: 1-12

.. _Diet templates: http://vibed.org/templates/diet


Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``vibe.d`` is a good example of the use of declarative programming with D. 
Service performs an *insert*, *select* and *remove* operations for user entries at a mongo collection.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/vibed-mongo/source/service.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4

App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following static constructor connects ``vibed`` database, creates the HTTP server and implements the error handler.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/vibed-mongo/source/app.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4
